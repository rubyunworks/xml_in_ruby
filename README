ABOUT

  "XML in Ruby" is a simple templating engine that allows you to embed
  XML directly into Ruby.

EXAMPLE

  See sample.rbx.
  
      class MyView < View
        def index(title)
          <html>
            <head>
              <title>${title}</title> 
            </head>
            <body>
              render_body
            </body>
          </html>
        end

        def render_body
          output "Hello World"
        end
      end

      puts MyView.render(:index, "Test")

  To start:

      ruby -r view -e "View.require 'sample.rbx'" 

  Output:

      <html>
      <head>
      <title>Test</title>
      </head>
      <body>
      Hello World</body>
      </html>

  You can mix XML and Ruby. Everything that starts with "<" as
  fist non-whitespace character on a line is considered as XML. 
  You can also use:

      <: This is text 

  to output the text " This is text", or require other
  "templates" with:

      View.require 'another_template.rbx'

  In XML you can embed Ruby code with #{...} and ${...}. The second
  performs escaping.
